[Collision With Each Other](https://github.com/zairysbigtae/Basic-Bouncing-Circles/tree/main/CollisionWithEachOther)

so i want to tell you something here, i want to make this repository as my project that i will be doing every day, every week.

so if you can, you could help me by contributing if you want to! although ive actually never tried contributions on github before..

and fun fact: this is my first repository with .git haha

### How to run it

```
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/zairysbigtae/Basic-Bouncing-Circles.git
cd Basic-Bouncing-Circles
git sparse-checkout all-exes
rm -rf .git
cd all_exes
```
now you can execute whatever simulations youd like!
```
./PingBouncingBalls
```
